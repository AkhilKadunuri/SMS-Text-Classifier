# SMS-Text-Classifier
📩 SMS Text Classifier using Neural Networks
This project is a machine learning application that classifies SMS messages as spam or not spam using a Neural Network model. It processes text data, learns underlying patterns, and predicts message categories with high accuracy.

🚀 Features
Binary classification: Spam vs Ham (Not Spam)

Preprocessing and vectorization of text using TF-IDF

Neural network with input, hidden, and output layers

Trained on labeled SMS datasets

Real-time prediction on new SMS inputs

Supports evaluation with accuracy metrics

🧠 How It Works
Data Collection
Load a dataset containing SMS messages with labels indicating whether they are spam or not.

Preprocessing

Clean the text (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.)

Convert text into numeric vectors using TF-IDF or word embeddings

Model Architecture

Input Layer: Takes vectorized text input

Hidden Layers: Learn non-linear patterns in the data

Output Layer: Outputs probability for spam/ham classification

Training

The model is trained using a loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy)

Optimizer (e.g., Adam) updates weights to minimize classification error

Evaluation

Assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on validation data

Prediction

New messages can be input for real-time classification

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of SMS messages containing two categories:

spam: Unwanted commercial messages

ham: Legitimate text messages

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Overall correct predictions

Precision: Correct spam predictions over all predicted spam

Recall: Correct spam predictions over all actual spam

F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

📌 Future Enhancements
Incorporate more advanced word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT)

Add GUI or API endpoint for SMS classification

Extend to multi-language SMS filtering
